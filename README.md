# frontend-developer-test
This is a short project for an interview test. 

I started learning React recently, so I first created the webpage in Angular, as I am more confident with it.
The two versions of the website have the same UI and the same CSS/SCSS code. 
I created tablet- and mobile-sized versions for the webpage. 
I used the same laptop illustration from the example picture, and I made its background tartsparent with GIMP. 

In the **other-tasks** folder you can find my answers for task 2, task 4 and the JavaScript function for the data fetching from an API. 
I used the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users URL for testing my function. I fetched the users as "Colors" and I assigned the username to the users.
